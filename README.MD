This is an application showcasing a few museums and landmarks in Washington DC.

To use this app, save the repository and open the index.html file in a browser of your choice (preferably Chrome).
Live version of the project here: https://rheechashaipu.github.io/googlemapsproject/

In the app, on the left, there is a menu with a search bar in which the user may search for locations. The list will update automatically and display locations matching the content in the search bar.

Clicking on a location name in the list will cause its corresponding map marker to bounce a couple times. Clicking on a marker will open an infowindow of the corresponding location. The infowindow will contain the location's title, short Wikipedia description, and a link for the location's Wikipedia article.
